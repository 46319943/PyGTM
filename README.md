# PyGTM
Python implementation of the Discrete Geographical Topic Model (DGTM).

# Issue
The code is accelerated using numba. This is just a compromised solution. Although numba provides a significant speedup, there are lots of issues and bugs with it. Some problems are hard to find and solve. The numba is also hard to use.

It should be implemented in other languages in furture for better performance and more control.
